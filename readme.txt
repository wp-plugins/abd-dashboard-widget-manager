Customize your WordPress administrator dashboard. You can choose which admin widgets to display, the user roles, and add your own dashboard content.

== Description ==

Take control of your admin dashboard!

This plugin gives you an easy way to customize your WordPress administrator dashboard. 

1. Select which user roles you'd like to customize.
1. select which admin dashboard widgets you'd like to have displayed. 
1. You also get the option to show a new 'custom widget' which you can then add your desired content. 

This custom widget is a great way to add documentation for your clients or leave notes for yourself right there on the admin dashboard when you or your users logs in. We use it for almost all of our clients so that they have documentation they need to manage their WordPress sites. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Within Settings, click on Dashboard Manager. This is where you'll configure your dashboard and enter content for your custom admin widget.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Does this plugin work with MultiPress? =

Yes, indeed it does.

= How do I add multiple custom widgets? =

You can't. It's quite possible that a future version will include this.

= Can I display a different custom widget for different roles? =

No. This only works for one set of user roles. The user roles that you select will see the dashboard that you've specified, including custom widget. All other user roles will see the WordPress default set of widgets.

== Screenshots ==

1. This is the WordPress admin dashboard after we've installed the plugin and configured to just show the  right now widget and our custom widget with documentation for our dear client.
2. This is the settings screen for the ABD Dashboard Widget Manager.
